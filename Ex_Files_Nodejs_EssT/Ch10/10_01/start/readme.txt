all code examples for chapter 10 were completed in the 10_01/start directory for simplicity.
-- up until 10_08 where he switches apps from warehouse app back to ski dictionary, so i move to 10_08

note instanbul was no longer in the npm registry.
so that lesson on code coverage was watched, but not implemented.
an additional test was added, but instanbul code coverage checker was not available

chapter_10_08 folder contains the work for 10_08 - 10_09
